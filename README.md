# 2Q.HackerRank-Python-2023

📝 Input Format: The program takes a single positive integer as input. This integer is denoted as n and represents a positive integer.

⚖️ Constraints: There are constraints on the value of n, but they are not specified in the explanation.

🎯 Output Format: The goal of the program is to print either "Weird" or "Not Weird" based on certain conditions.

🧮 Conditional Actions: The program performs a series of conditional checks on the input integer n:

Condition 1: If n is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), it prints "Weird."
Condition 2: If n is even (i.e., divisible by 2) and falls within the inclusive range of 2 to 5, it prints "Not Weird."
Condition 3: If n is even (i.e., divisible by 2) and falls within the inclusive range of 6 to 20, it prints "Weird."
Condition 4: If n is even (i.e., divisible by 2) and greater than 20, it prints "Not Weird."
🖥️ Sample Input 0: In the first sample input, n is 3, which is odd. Therefore, it satisfies Condition 1, and the program prints "Weird."
🖥️ Sample Output 0: The output for Sample Input 0 is "Weird," as explained above.
🖥️ Sample Input 1: In the second sample input, n is 24, which is even. It falls into the range specified in Condition 4 (greater than 20), so the program prints "Not Weird."
🖥️ Sample Output 1: The output for Sample Input 1 is "Not Weird," as explained above.
